## Sentience Spread

The Colonids are a fascinating specimen, between their extremophile tendencies and ability to create Plasmamen. A much more mundane, but still notable proprety of the colonids, is their lifecycle. Colonids have both a inert and active state; in their active state they're alive, chilling in plasma rivers or, more recently, inhabiting a human skeleton and walking around a space station. Sometimes the colonids bloom and spread their spores into their enviroment. These spores are the inert phase; they then drift through the harsh wind of the icemoon Freyja in search of a new plasma river to colonize, becoming active again in contact with plasma.

What none of the researchers found out, however, is that this method of reproduction is the key to many of the Spinward Sector's mysteries -  The research on long-term plasma exposure was too high level and of a different field for the biologists to connect the dots. The truth is, one of Space Station 13's biggest mysteries can be explained via this lifecycle - the Sentience Spread.

The Sentience Spread is the name given to the recent phenomena of sentience being found in many otherwise non-sentient species and objects from corgis, cows, spiders and to even vending machines inside of the Spinward Sector. Furthermore, NT employees in the sector have found to have gotten a much higher rate of imaginary friends and dissociations than usual, and with methods of operation noticeably different from what traditional psychology knows. 

The reason, of course, is because of the Colonids. Inactive Colonids inside of the infected creature's system started activating due to the long term exposition to plasma. In weak-willed creatures this manifests in them suddently spouting conciousness while in strong-willed creatures an imaginary friend or split personality may sprout - or, sometimes, just an irresistible urge to eat plasma or to walk head first into the Supermatter chamber. Even more rare other more exotic forms of sentience may arize - sentience on the small bots around the stations, on vending machines or, most dangerous of all, on diseases, forming the dangerous Sentient Disease.  How far or how big a colony of Colonids can be while keeping the same conciousness is still unknown - but a sentient disease outbreak would be a nasty way of figuring out.

## Roleplay Notes
- The effects and methods of sentience spread is left intentionally vague and non-conclusive. Not every instance of a sentient pet or sentient disease needs to be caused by this, for example, and other stuff not listed here can be used as being from sentience spread. This is a springboard for gimmicks and roleplaying ideas and not a hard rule for all the antags and creatures listed here.
